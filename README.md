# Timezone and current date

## thinking process
1. started as MFE test with Web Components
2. no need to pass to apps data, props etc, but real world app consideration, no routing needed
3. given time limit, to create bare minimum to demo
4. didn't add eslint, prettier or any static types for simplicity, mandatory for big apps or big teams
5. use oss WC wrapper rather than handle low level API for simplicity
6. WC doesn't handle bundle size
